## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Python SDK first, UI later — Balance flexibility for consultants with templated UI later
- scikit-learn style API — OOP for models/optimizers, functional helpers, familiar to data scientists
- Water pipes for v1 — Validate architecture before generalizing to other domains
- Weibull deterioration model — Well-understood statistical baseline
- Pluggable optimizer interface — Greedy heuristic first, MILP later via same interface
- Single deterministic run — No Monte Carlo in v1, but architecture allows it later

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
