## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2 Roadmap]: Build order: Proportional Hazards -> Roads -> Groupings -> Hierarchy (docs integrated in each phase)
- [v2 Roadmap]: Phase numbering continues from v1 (starts at 7, ends at 10)

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 07.1 inserted after Phase 7: Documentation Workflow — jupytext-based .py → .ipynb workflow so agents write .py files instead of notebooks (INSERTED)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-05
Stopped at: Roadmap created, ready to plan Phase 7
Resume file: None

## Next Steps

1. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 7` to create execution plans for Proportional Hazards
2. Execute plans to implement ProportionalHazardsModel
3. Verify phase completion before moving to Phase 8
