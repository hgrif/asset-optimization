# Phase 07.1 Plan 02: Notebook Migration Summary

## What Was Built

1. **Percent-format sources (numbered)**
   - Created `notebooks/01_quickstart.py` and `notebooks/02_proportional_hazards.py` in Jupytext percent format.
   - Converted markdown cells to `# %% [markdown]` with triple-quoted content and kept tutorial-style tone.
   - Preserved all original sections and the cleanup cell in the quickstart notebook.

2. **Synced notebooks**
   - Generated `notebooks/01_quickstart.ipynb` and `notebooks/02_proportional_hazards.ipynb` via Jupytext sync.
   - Retired the unnumbered notebook pairs (`quickstart.*`, `proportional_hazards.*`).

3. **Lint compatibility**
   - Added `# ruff: noqa: E402` to align notebook-style import placement with ruff rules.

## Deviations From Plan

- Used `make docs-sync` to drive Jupytext syncing instead of direct `uv run jupytext --sync` for consistency with Makefile targets.

## Verification Results

- `make docs-sync` (pass)
- Notebook pairs synced without outputs; old unnumbered files removed.

## Notes / Follow-ups

- Full quality gates (`make lint`, `make test`, `make docs`) not run in this phase.
